 * backdoor- a feature or defect of a computer system that allows surreptitious unauthorized access to data 
  * botnet- a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge
  * brute force- Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies
  * exploit- An exploit is the use of software, data, or commands to “exploit” a weakness in a computer system or program to carry out some form of malicious intent, such as a denial-of-service attack, Trojan horses, worms or viruses.
  * key logger- a computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, especially in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information

  * port scan- A port scan is a series of messages sent by someone attempting to break into a computer to learn which computer network services, each associated with a "well-known" port number, the computer provides. Port scanning, a favorite approach of computer cracker, gives the assailant an idea where to probe for weaknesses.
  * ransomware- a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
  * rootkit- a set of software tools that enable an unauthorized user to gain control of a computer system without being detected.
  * worm- Computer worm. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. ... A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.

  * zero day- deriving from or relating to a previously unknown vulnerability to attack in some software.

  Pharming-Pharming refers to an attempt by a hacker to redirect a website’s traffic to another site, developed for the purpose of stealing information from users. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in either the host files on a personal computer or on the domain name system (DNS) server software. DNS servers work to direct information on the internet, similar to a road map for traffic. Compromised DNS servers are referred to as “poisoned.”
